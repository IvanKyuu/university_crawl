# April 26, 2024 Uplanner meeting: Web Scrapping Go Over

## Problems
example from the output of UW
1. AI could be lazy....
   1. Generated faculties:
      1. expect: `["Science, faculty of", ....]`
      2. Got only: `["Science, Faculty of"]`
   2. possible fix:
      1. change prompt, and some how force it to aiming on general admin page instead of the web page of a specific faculty
2. Tavily could still make things up:
   1. Generated statistics:
      `"statistics": "[\"Undergraduate Programs: 1\", \"Master's and PhD Programs: 1\"]"`
   2. possible fix:
      1. langchain + recursive web scraping over the official websites
         1. disadvantage:
            1. could take forever due to the limitation of the computation powers
            2. later LLM could also be very costly, and some model may not even be able to the handle so much of the data
            3. hard to implement
            4. could fail due to any link towards the outside internet
         2. advantage:
            1. very accurate output
         3. **Checkout** Recursive URL on langchain
3. Result not deterministic
   1. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
   2. possible fix:
      1. multiple call -> store -> pipeline to another LLM to choose the best one
   3. **TODO**: document check / temperature
4. LLM or even browser sweet point or phishing point? 
   1. example:
      1. [INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS & PLANNING](https://uwaterloo.ca/institutional-analysis-planning/university-data-and-statistics/faculty-data)
5. Attribute name may leads to wrong result
   1. example:
      1. graduation year, statistics
   2. possible fix:
      1. creating mapping:
         +  SQL database attribute_name -> actual what that is
      2. and use the mapped value to do the research
   3. **Done**

## Problems that I fixed
1. Output formatting (data clean up):
   1. resolution:
      1. tell LLM not to make things up, and hope they won't. They are not doing for some attribute `[ranking, ]`, but still for others.
      2. manually filter out some possible tokens may indicate that LLM don't know anything: `token_not_know = ["not ranked", "not available", "not know"]`
2. Specify the handler for each attribute of universities:
   1. add `handler` in `university_attribute_format`
   2. let each `handler` solve the assigned question, with `GPT_GENERAL` being the last choice, e.g. create a chain of data processing

## Suggested next steps:
1. `RecursiveURL` on langchain + k_value
   1. figure out a way to cache them some how if the LLM can't consume that much
2. Web specific crawler over ranking websites:
   1. `ApifyWrapper` on langchain, or even standard
3. Retriever is not getting enough as I needed
   1. Tell Tavily to load the whole page?
      1. sometimes works now
4. Separate university website from the outer websites `ranking_qs_news_2024`
   1. two Langchain methods
      1. Done: ranking has a different method

___
Still finding time to read the document of Langchain, too long.
