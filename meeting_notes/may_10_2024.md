   1. problems remain:
      1. usnews only contains Canadian universities for now.
         1. Cause: dynamic page with Javascript.
         2. Attempt: Selenium wrapper + BeautifulSoup.
         3. I only made the small pages works, and the memory ran out pretty quickly.
   
2. programs datasets from ARWU.
   1. problems:
      1. \# of universities are low.
      2. each university may have sub-schools (Rotman of UofT)
         1. yes
         2. A new page for each?
      3. duplicates of programs on ARWU, though total \# of programs may not be enough.
         1. removing duplicates resulting in less programs comparing to the official websites.
