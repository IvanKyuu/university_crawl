## Next meeting:
Friday, 8:30 PM. Apr 26, 2024

## Resource:
1. [working extract info](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CicjqDh97Ob4S339BG8jL0dRjtBug3q8AC2KiPrgHUE/edit#gid=1820803381)
SpreadSheet usageï¼š
   1. `target_university_list`: columns of input universities.
   2. `university_attribute_format`: format, extract prompt, examples for each attributes.
   3. `example_output`: example of generated output, currently covers top10 rows of `target_university_list` + some well-known universities that we already have the data.

## TODOs
1. Format my output
   1. `statistics`: 
      1. example: "Undergraduate: 108 Master's and PhD: 180"
   2. `ranking_*`:
      1. leave a blank space if GPT can't find any.
   3. `faculty`: name of faculty.
   + Possible solution: Divide my GPT_client through the output format + enforce the fine tuning over output format.

2. Consider to use general content scrapping/crawl over html, then create embedding and feed into GPT in terms.
3. Consider using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, which I haven't learnt anything about it.
   1. [What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/)
4. [Browse AI](https://www.browse.ai/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=Search-tcpa-broad&utm_content=Website%20Scraping&utm_ad=689312777005&utm_term=web%20scraping&matchtype=b&ad_id=689312777005&gad_source=1), its document says it can do web scraping. Will try tomorrow.
   + This is basically a selenium wrapper, will be helpful if all the recourses are on the same link, a bit restrict at the moment, but could be helpful handling the ranking things.

5. [python.langchain Web scraping](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/web_scraping/), which might use synthesis + syntax match. It can be used combining with BeautifulSoup and GenAI. 
   1. If installation error occurs, check [import langchain => Error : TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class](https://stackoverflow.comquestions/76313592/import-langchain-error-typeerror-issubclass-arg-1-must-be-a-class)
